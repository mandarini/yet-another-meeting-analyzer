# Old Migrations (Legacy)

This folder contains legacy Supabase migration files that were generated by Bolt as the database schema evolved through multiple iterations and refactors.

- These migrations are **kept for historical reference only**.
- They reflect the various approaches and experiments made during the development of the Yama schema, especially around roles, policies, and access control.
- **New setups should use the consolidated migration** (`20250601000000_consolidated_schema.sql`) in the main `migrations` folder, which represents the current, clean schema and access control model.

If you need to understand the evolution of the schema or debug legacy data, you may refer to these files. Otherwise, you can ignore this folder for new deployments and development.
