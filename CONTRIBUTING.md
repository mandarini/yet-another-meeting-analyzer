# Contributing & Onboarding Guide for Yama (Yet Another Meeting Analyzer)

Welcome! This guide is for anyone looking to contribute to Yama, the Nx team's meeting analysis tool. Here you'll find everything you need to get started as a developer or contributor: codebase structure, setup instructions, deployment steps, and environment configuration.

Whether you're new to the project or looking to deploy your own instance, this document will help you understand how Yama works and how to get involved.

## Codebase Map

This section provides an overview of the main parts of the codebase to help new contributors quickly understand the structure and responsibilities of each part.

### Top-Level Structure

  - **`analyze-transcript/`** — Handles transcript analysis using OpenAI and updates the database.
  - **`auth/`** — Handles authentication events and audit logging.

- **`supabase/migrations/`** — SQL migration scripts for database schema changes. Read the section below.

---

### Other

- **`README.md`** — General project overview and features.
- **`CONTRIBUTING.md`** — Contributor and onboarding guide (this file).

---

**How to Use This Map:**

- Start with `App.tsx` and `main.tsx` to understand app flow and routing.
- Explore `pages/` for main features and navigation.
- Check `lib/supabase.ts` for all backend interactions.
- Use `components/` for reusable UI and layout.
- See `stores/` for state management patterns.
- Backend logic and migrations are in `supabase/`.

---

## Database Migrations: What to Know

- The `supabase/migrations/old_migrations/` folder contains **legacy migration files** generated by bolt during earlier schema iterations. These are kept for historical reference only and should not be used for new setups.
- **New setups should use the consolidated migration** (`20250601000000_consolidated_schema.sql`) in the main `migrations` folder, which represents the current, clean schema and access control model.
- All new migrations are clearly commented at the top to explain their purpose and scope.

---

## Deployment & Setup: When Is It Needed?

> **Note:** The app is already fully deployed and configured. You do **not** need to perform any deployment or setup steps to use or contribute to the project as it exists today.
>
> **The instructions below are only needed if you want to set up the project from scratch (clean slate), such as for a new environment or a major migration.**

- The production deployment is managed automatically by Netlify, which is connected to the nrwl org GitHub repository. Every push to `main` triggers an auto-deploy.
- The Supabase database is already set up and requires no further configuration.
- All environment variables and OAuth settings are already in place.
- For Netlify settings, contact Jack. For Google OAuth, contact Steve.

If you **do** need to **set up from scratch**, follow the instructions below:

---

## 1. Prerequisites

- Access to the Nx team's Supabase project
- Access to the OpenAI API (to get the API key for transcript analysis) - it is already set up
- Deployment platform for the frontend (access to Nx's Netlify account)

---

## 2. Environment Variables & Secrets

### Frontend (Vite)

Set these in your deployment platform's environment variable settings, or in a `.env` file for local development:

- `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` — Your Supabase project URL
- `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` — Supabase anon public key

**Example `.env` for local dev:**

```env
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key
```

### Supabase Edge Functions (in `supabase/functions/`)

Set these in the Supabase dashboard under Project Settings > Environment Variables:

- `SUPABASE_URL` — Your Supabase project URL
- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` — Supabase service role key (keep this secret!)
- `OPENAI_API_KEY` — Your OpenAI API key (for transcript analysis)

**Note:** These are required for both `analyze-transcript` and `auth` functions.

---

## 3. Deployment Steps

### Automatic Deployment with Netlify

Deployment is handled automatically via Netlify by connecting the GitHub repository to the Nx team's Netlify account. Every push to the main branch (or any configured branch) will trigger a new deployment.

**To set up or manage deployments:**

1. Ensure you have access to the Nx team's Netlify account and the GitHub repository.
2. In Netlify, create a new site and select the GitHub repository for Yama.
3. Netlify will automatically detect the build settings (Vite) and prompt you to set the required environment variables (`VITE_SUPABASE_URL`, `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`).
4. Once connected, every push to the repository will trigger a build and deploy the latest version to the configured Netlify site.

> **Important:**
> If you change the Netlify site URL (for example, when renaming the site or switching domains), you **must** contact the Nx Google Auth admin to update the allowed redirect URIs and domains in the Google Auth settings. You may also need to update the Auth settings in the Supabase dashboard to reflect the new site URL. Failing to do so will break authentication for all users.

#### Google Auth Setup for Supabase

To enable Sign in with Google for Yama, you need to configure the following in the Supabase Auth settings and in the Google Cloud Console:

- **Enable Sign in with Google** in Supabase Auth settings.
- **Client IDs:**
  - Comma-separated list of client IDs for Web, OAuth, Android apps, One Tap, and Chrome extensions. Obtain these from the Google Cloud Console for the Nx team.
- **Client Secret (for OAuth):**
  - The client secret associated with the above client IDs (from Google Cloud Console).
- **Callback URL (for OAuth):**
  - `https://XXXX.supabase.co/auth/v1/callback`
  - This must be registered as an authorized redirect URI in the Google Cloud Console for the OAuth client.

> **Tip:** If you update the Netlify site URL or Supabase project, you may need to update the allowed redirect URIs and domains in both Google Cloud Console and Supabase Auth settings.

For more details, see the official Supabase documentation: [Configure your services (Google Auth)](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth/social-login/auth-google#configure-your-services-id)

---

## 4. Authentication & Access

- Only users with `@nrwl.io` email addresses can log in (enforced via Google Auth).
- Make sure Google Auth is enabled in your Supabase project and configured for the correct domain.
- Super admin setup is handled via migrations (see `supabase/migrations/`).

---

## 5. Troubleshooting

- If you see errors about missing environment variables, double-check that all required variables are set in both the frontend and Supabase dashboard.
- For OpenAI errors, ensure your API key is valid and has sufficient quota.

---

## 6. Reference

- For general usage and feature overview, see [README.md](./README.md).
- For contributing, see the Nx team guidelines.
